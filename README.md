# tutedude assignment 5 part 1
This is a simple Python program that stores marks for a set of students and allows users to look up a student's marks by entering their name.
Users can input a student's name to retrieve their marks.
If the student exists: displays marks.
If not: shows a message saying the student is not found.
Uses basic Python concepts like dictionaries, user input, and if-else logic.
example-:
Enter the student's name: Charlie
Charlie's marks: 92
Enter the student's name: John
Student not found in the records.

# tutedude assignment 5 part2
- Creates a List from 1 to 10
-Uses Python's range() function to create a list of integers.
-Extracts the first five elements from the list .
-Reverses the extracted sublist using slicing with a negative step ([::-1]).
-prints both the original sliced list and its reversed version.

How to Run the Program-:

numbers = list(range(1, 11))
first_five = numbers[:5]
reversed_five = first_five[::-1]
print("First five elements:", first_five)
print("Reversed list:", reversed_five)
Example Output
First five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
